							<h3>Objective</h3>
							<p>Team DJANIC and UCI recognize that human trafficking is a global issue and that a solution is needed to educate people all over the world on human trafficking and how it affects lives. Especially with current world wide situations, like the Syrian Refugee crisis, human trafficking has been on the rise. Examples of human trafficking are sex, labor and organ trafficking. People under the age of 18 are often victims of sex trafficking, as many are seduced by groups of individuals disguised as friendly and/or younger people who are looking to help or be a friend. In past decades, before the rise of computers, it was not as easy for “strangers” outside of the family to get in contact with children. Predators were much more scarce during a time when they had to actually go outside to find their prey. Technology has made it easier for these malicious individuals to target children and to keep themselves hidden to protect their identities.</br>
							In today's generation, children are exposed to technology and the Internet at an early stage of their lives. Many children have technologies such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets before they finish grade school. While technology and the pervasiveness of technology in society is largely seen as beneficial, it doesn’t get by without some detriments as well. Children benefit from technology as it allows them to conduct their own research on practically anything they would like to know. The Huffington Post wrote an article in which it claims that, “moderate screen time can carry significant educational benefits for young children.” Technology also allows them to remain connected with long-distance friends and family. Technology positively impacts children's lives in many ways; however, it leaves them susceptible to being mislead by a malicious individual or group of individuals which can result in drastic consequences such as being trafficked, and/or exposed.</br>
							With the rise of online gaming in recent years, the risk of being trafficked has risen. Recently, as online gaming and chat rooms have become more popular amongst children and young adults, more and more of them have been left open to be contacted by malicious individuals who are disguised via technology. Games such as Grand Theft Auto and smartphone applications such as Kik have paved the road for predators to more easily find their prey.  These are just a couple examples of the many ways children and adults can be lured in to be trafficked. 
							Team DJANIC is partnering with Million Kids, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, to develop a smartphone application. This application's main functionality is to educate the world on the nature of human trafficking, and how to react in situations in which the user feels they, or someone they love, may be a victim of human trafficking.</br>
							This application will feature a section for parents, and a section for children, but this does not mean that children will not be able to access the section for parents. Similarly, Parents will have the ability to access the children’s side of the application as well. Parents are meant to have a more informational and mature section, as there will be a few short clips and a section that describes human trafficking and different types of human trafficking. Included, as well, will be different broad categories regarding human trafficking that the user can click on to narrow down what they would like to learn. This is meant to educate the parents on the potential dangers of human trafficking and how to recognize it.</br>
							For children, there will be an educational game available to play, which will provide several different scenarios in which children will be able to interact with and learn about how to protect themselves from the dangers of human trafficking. This game will play as a “choose your own destiny” type adventure game. The scenarios will change depending on which answer you select to provide a more unique and interesting experience for the children. The game’s scenarios will be separated into different categories based on the age range that the user selects to play as. As the game progresses the user will accumulate a running total of how many good and bad answers they chose which will help the game logic to determine which path they will head down. Throughout the game there will be tips and reminders of what to do in certain situations as well as important points telling the child what the best course of action would have been if they chose an incorrect answer that would lead to them potentially being trafficked.</br>
							We hope that the development of this mobile application will help reduce and potentially eliminate human trafficking by educating all the individuals worldwide. If we can reduce the number of people being trafficked, even by a small percentage, it will be better than how it was and will be a step in the right direction.</br>
